Alignment files for the master data set.

Files are in Fasta format. Regions of the alignments that are defined 
as structurally conserved regions (SCRs) are represented in uppercase 
letters. Regions not in SCRs are in lowercase letters.

An SCR is a contiguous set of 3 or more alignment columns for which
the STAMP Pij' score is 6 or greater in each column. See the Oxbench
paper for more details.
